# 🚀 SHL Assessment Recommendation Engine


## 📋 Project Description

The SHL Assessment Recommendation Engine is an intelligent system designed to help organizations and HR professionals select the most appropriate SHL assessments for their specific needs. This AI-powered solution combines machine learning algorithms with natural language processing to provide personalized assessment recommendations based on job roles, assessment requirements, and experience levels.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Intelligent Matching**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to match SHL products with specific job roles and assessment needs
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Considers multiple parameters including:
  - Job role requirements
  - Assessment objectives
  - Experience levels
  - Category matching
  - Semantic similarity
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Provides instant, data-driven suggestions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each recommendation comes with a confidence score
- **RESTful API**: Easy integration with existing HR systems
- **Modern Web Interface**: User-friendly dashboard for easy interaction

### 🧠 Technical Implementation

The engine is built using state-of-the-art technologies:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses sentence transformers for semantic understanding
- **Machine Learning**: Implements custom scoring algorithms for precise matching
- **API Architecture**: RESTful endpoints with FastAPI for high performance
- **Data Processing**: Efficient handling of product catalogs and user inputs
- **Scalable Design**: Ready for enterprise-level deployment

### 🏢 Use Cases

- **HR Departments**: Streamline assessment selection process
- **Recruitment Agencies**: Match candidates with appropriate assessments
- **Learning & Development**: Identify suitable assessments for training programs
- **Career Development**: Guide employees in their professional growth
- **Talent Management**: Support comprehensive talent assessment strategies

### 🔄 How It Works

1. **Input Collection**: Users provide:
   - Job role description
   - Assessment needs
   - Experience level (optional)
2. **Processing**: The engine:
   - Analyzes input using NLP
   - Matches against product database
   - Calculates confidence scores
3. **Output**: Returns:
   - Ranked list of recommended products
   - Confidence scores
   - Detailed product information
